   EMS - Managed Cloud REST API
   This section will provide necessary information about the `CoinAPI EMS Managed Cloud REST API` protocol.  <br/><br/> This API is used to manage the overall deployment of **Execution Management System API** (`EMS API`) software,  which means that in this API, you define the accounts, credentials, and configurations for the order destinations or identify the CoinAPI endpoints where you need to connect to access the `EMS API`.  <br/><br/> Implemented Standards:   * [HTTP1.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945)  * [HTTP1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616)  * [HTTP2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540)   ### Endpoints <table>   <thead>     <tr>       <th>Environment</th>       <th>Url</th>     </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>     <tr>       <td>Production</td>       <td><code>https://ems-mgmt.coinapi.io/</code></td>     </tr>     <tr>       <td>Sandbox</td>       <td><code>https://ems-mgmt-sandbox.coinapi.io/</code></td>     </tr>   </tbody> </table>  ### Authentication  To use resources that require authorized access, you will need to provide an API key to us when making HTTP requests.  There are 2 methods for passing the API key to us, you only need to use one:   1. Custom authorization header named `X-CoinAPI-Key`  2. Query string parameter named `apikey`  #### Custom authorization header  You can authorize by providing additional custom header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` and API key as its value.  Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like: <br/><br/> `X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`  <aside class=\"success\">This method is recommended by us and you should use it in production environments.</aside>  #### Query string authorization parameter  You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named `apikey` with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.  Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY` and that you want to request all accounts, then your query string should look like this:  <br/><br/> `GET /v1/accounts?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`  <aside class=\"notice\"> Query string method may be more practical for development activities. </aside>
